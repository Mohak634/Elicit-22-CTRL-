                <h2><p id="intro">Artist's block is a phase many artists and creators go through. It is defined as the lack of ideas and motivation required to produce art. If you are an artist, you're probably familiar with how depressive a creative rut can be. Which is why we created UnBlock.</p> <br>UnBlock is a community based application designed with the aim of helping artists get back in full swing via the use of resources such as articles and videos from other creators who've gone through the same.</h2>
